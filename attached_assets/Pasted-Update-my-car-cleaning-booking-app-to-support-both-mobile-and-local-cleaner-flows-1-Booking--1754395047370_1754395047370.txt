Update my car cleaning booking app to support both mobile and local cleaner flows.

🧼 1. Booking Flow for Mobile Cleaners (Cleaner comes to user):
- Screen 1: Service Selection
   - Display selected cleaner, service, and prices.
   - Allow user to select optional add-ons (e.g., Waxing +50 MAD).
   - Dynamically update total price.
   - Confirm Booking button.

- Screen 2: Booking Pending
   - Show status message: “Waiting for cleaner to accept...”
   - Cleaner receives push notification to accept or decline.
   - If accepted: show ETA (e.g., “Arriving in 15 min”) + cleaner location on map (optional).
   - Status bar: “En Route” → “Arrived” → “Service Completed”

📍 2. Booking Flow for Local Cleaners (Garage-based):
- After selecting a garage cleaner:
   - Screen 1: Select Service + Available Time Slot
      - Show calendar view with free slots.
      - Add-ons optional.
      - Estimated total time shown.
   - Screen 2: Booking Confirmation
      - Show confirmation screen with:
         - Garage location (map)
         - Chosen time
         - Service summary
      - User will drive to the garage. No tracking needed.
      - Optional: “Mark as arrived” button (for future update)

📡 3. Shared Features (for both types):
- Use Supabase Realtime to update booking status.
- Send push or SMS notifications:
   - Booking request sent
   - Booking accepted/rejected
   - Service completed
- Store service options, cleaner status, and bookings in backend.

📁 4. Database Updates:
- Add `booking_type` to `bookings` table: "mobile" or "garage"
- Add `status` field: pending / confirmed / in_progress / completed
- Add `add_ons` as a list or related table
- Add `garage_slots` table:
  - garage_id, start_time, is_booked

🎨 5. UI Guidelines:
- Use existing design style (modern, clean)
- Make all screens responsive for mobile & web
- Use icons for service type, status, and cleaner mode (car icon = mobile cleaner, garage icon = fixed)

🧪 6. Deliverables:
- 3 new screens: Mobile Booking Flow, Garage Booking Flow, Booking Confirmation
- Updated Supabase schema for booking logic
- Working code + frontend wiring (no payments for now)
